CrIS J4 Nov-Dec 2023 TVAC gas cell tests and analysis
------------------------------------------------------

The git repo does not include mat files from the working version,
which would take up too much space for github.  So you can't run or
rerun the tests from the repo.  The github version does include all
fig and pdf files for the reports.  These notes are for the direct
transmittance method, working from count spectra; see README.cal for
transmittance from calibrated radiances.

The man steps for the original direct transmittance method are

  1. grab a subset from the packet stream spanning each test leg
     with shell script commands, see e.g. harvest_mn/harvest.txt

  2. find the ES (gas cell) looks with spec_test1.m.  comment out
     any time subsetting and run each leg a few times to get new
     subsets.

  3. use spec_test2.m for an initial comparison of obs and calc

  4. use fit_run.m to fit obs to cals and get met laser residuals

Work is done first in the harvest and then the gas cell test
directories, for example harvest_ph and 11-17_ph_s1_CO2.  The
initial harvest steps are shell commands listed in harvest.txt,
in each harvest directory.  This produces four CCSDS packet files:
ET1, ET2, FT1, and FT2.dat in the gas cell test directories.  These
are translated to .mat files with source/dat2mat.m.  dat2mat needs
an initial btrim_cache.mat file from a similar test.

If the Excel summary logs for the ILS tests are not available,
the next step is to get an overview of the gas cell test data, by
running source/read.ccs.m.  This produces a summary plot for one
day, and saves a summary of the ccs data for that day, for example
ccs_data_02_12.mat.  Then edit and run plot_legs_LW, MW, and SW,
using start and stop times saved in harvest.txt, to see gas cell
details of each test leg.  The edited plot_legs scripts become the
home for the gas cell measurements.

Then run spec_test1 to get the ES (gas cell look) subintervals.
Comment out any old time spans in the switch tleg statement, run
spec test, zoom in on the gas cell subsequence, and add the new
times.  spec_test1 plots count spectra as a function of frequency,
and (for a single channel) as a function of time.  This is used to
trim the harvesting to just the ES looks.  spec_test1 gives index
limits used by spec_test2 and fit_run.  spec_test2 plots obs and
calc together, and fit_run fits obs to calcs.

Directories
------------
reports        - final reports
source         - common source code
inst_data      - instrument data, mainly from ccast
mm-dd_*_s?_*   - tests by date, segment, side, and gas
harvest_??     - harvest notes and scripts, p

Test Scripts
-------------
fit_run   - set up test params, call fit_tran, plot results;
    fit_run -> fit_tran -> cmp_tran

fit_plots - FOV breakouts and other plots, followup to fit_run

spec_test1 - quick look at gas cell count spectra with data from
    ccast/MITreader380b/read_cris_ccsds and ccast/source routines
    inst_params and igm2spec

spec_test2 - a basic comparison of observed and calculated gas cell
    transmittance, without any fitting, using ccast libs and kc2cris
    from the airs_decon package

Functions
----------
cmp_tran  - compare observed and calculated transmittances
fit_tran  - find wlaser deltas to match obs and calc
dat2mat   - call read_cris_ccsds on harvested data
read_ccs  - read and tabulate selected CCS fields
read_igm  - simple wrapper to read IGMs with the MIT reader
fit_info  - print fit_tran residuals and weights
fovcolors - 9 distinct colors for FOV plots
fovnames  -  FOV names for plot legend
